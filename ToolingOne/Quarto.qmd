Presentation by Dr Venet Osmani (v.osmani@sheffield.ac.uk), 
CA-GAN to create synthetic records, for xample disadvantaged groups; more efficient that machine learning onreal data.
May improve access to real clinical data and advance research.

Example: clinical data from patient with sepsis and hypotension. 
Goal: represent groups from black ethnic minority only.

Evaluation of SD remains an issue. No agreed metric, no consensus about it in the litterature. 
roaches Qualitative (visualisation)
See photos;
QUantitative: distribution distance of the dataset or specific variableS.

Correlation between variables in the datasets; 


Competing objectives:
  privacy protection vs precision/matching with degree of didelity.

Improving User computer interface.

How computers, roboits, etc can nfer emtional states, etc using brain signals from EEG. 
There are now off the shelves EEG devices.
Proble: lo of noise arising from muscle activity and non related brain activity.
Users are asked to repeat the activity (ie imagine moving a hand) a lot of time.
Lots of data required t; each calibration data requires 20-30 mins;
changes between people, days. More data needed

--> Synthetic data, especially from smaller groups.

Hybrid dataset with mixed of real data vs synthetic data
See ONS six levels of synthetic data(
  
- Crucial issue: bias

  Other presenter
Travel data of 'bad guys' via PNR data.
How to create synthetic data without accessing the real microdata

Steps:
1- Generate synthetic population (of the whole EU!)
2- Agent based modelling of behaviour

Accounting for household composition, duration of stay, itinerary/routes
