## Plan
- Three presentations:

  1. Basic of document creation with Quarto
  2. Using Git and GitHub for version control
  3. Online collaboration with GitHub

- Today:

  1. What is Quarto
  2. Structure and basic components
  3. A simple example
  4. More complex documents


#  1. What is Quarto?

## In a nutshell

- Open-source scientific and technical publishing system 
- Developed by [Posit](https://posit.co/) (< [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/))
- Next generation of Markdown, based on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- At the core  a bare-bones, text-based **markup language**.
- A markup language is a series of rules and conventions for designing documents and their components. 
- Other examples of markup languages:   html and LaTeX.
- Quarto is a standalone application; run either from an IDE (RStudio) or as a Command Line Interface (cli) in a terminal

## Features
- Produces documents in a multitude of formats  (27): 
    - Traditional (ie printable): pdf, html, .docx/odt, .ppt
    - Digital documents: ePub, MediaWiki 
- Single files, complex documents ie books and websites
- Manages formulas, images, animations
- Run R, Python, Julia code and display output
- Shiny apps (still in progress)
- Facilitates reproducible research
- Time saving for documents that include code or code output

## How does it work?

- Typical workflow:

  1.  Begins with creating a syntax file:
  
      - Text document with a .qmd extension
  2. Render (ie compile) the document
  3. Visualise the results
  4. Further edit/amend the document
  5. Render again...
  - RStudio provides quasi WYSIWIG document edition
  
#    2. Basic components of Quarto documents


## Basic structure

- Two main components:
    - Header
    - Main content
    
- Header
  - Denoted by three hyphens
  - Specific language: YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
  - Consist of  a number of standardised options, typically: 
  
    - Title, author,  date, and document output format
  - Options may be  document-wide  or 'suboptions'
  
## Example: syntax of this presentation

## What is Quarto

- Open-source scientific and technical publishing system 
- Developed by Posit, (< RStudio and Tidyverse)
- Originates in Markdown and R Markdown
- At the core is  a simplified, text-based **markup language**.

```


## Running R Code (1)

```{r r_demo}
#| echo: true

x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
y <- dnorm(x)
plot(x,y, type = "l", lwd = 2, axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "")
axis(1, at = -3:3, labels = c("-3s", "-2s", "-1s", "mean", "1s", "2s", "3s"))

```

## The code can either be visible or not

The same plot with the R code hidden


```{r r_demo_hidden}
#| echo: false

x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
y <- dnorm(x)
plot(x,y, type = "l", lwd = 2, axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "")
axis(1, at = -3:3, labels = c("-3s", "-2s", "-1s", "mean", "1s", "2s", "3s"))

```


## Stata Code

```{stata stata_code}
sysuse auto, clear
describe
```

## Python code 
```{python python_demo}
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import norm

#x-axis ranges from -3 and 3 with .001 steps
x = np.arange(-3, 3, 0.001)

#plot normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
plt.plot(x, norm.pdf(x, 0, 1))
```



## RStudio and Quarto

- Full integration of Quarto within RStudio IDE
- Features:

  - Syntax highlighting
  - Python (< Jupyter), R(< knitR), Stata code chunks integration
  - Document rendering and visualisation

- Edited and run (almost) like any R syntax file

#  3. A simple example 

## What we will do

- Create a Quarto document in RStudio
- Go through basic stylistic conventions
- Rendering in different formats
- Code chunks

#  4. More advanced aspects of document creation  

## Additional topics for online documents

- Uniformising branding and formatting across documents

  - [Practical BSA material](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/Introduction_to_the_BSA/blob/main/Population%20estimates%20using%20the%20BSAS%20with%20R.qmd)

- Creating complex documents (books and websites)
  
   - [R Guide](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/UKDS_RGuide)

## Additional resources

- The [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) is a must for a comprehensive list of format specific options and capabilities.
